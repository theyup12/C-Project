# Assigment_9

Instructions for the program are inside the linkedlist.cpp file.

NOTE: A function can be called with an empty list, so make sure your program accounts for that. Also consider what your function will do if there is only 1 node - it may need to handle this case separately.

## Compile the code with:
clang++ -std=c++17 main.cpp linkedlist.cpp -o main

## Execute the code with:
./main
